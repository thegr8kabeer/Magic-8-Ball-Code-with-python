# Magic-8-Ball-Code-with-python
It's a simple short code that a python user can understand in no time
It uses basic syntax (while and for loops).
We only have to import only two modules i.e.
The 'sys' module in python,
and 
The 'random' module of python (for generating random answers for the magic ball)
