# Magic-8-Ball-Code-with-python
It's a simple short code that a python user can understand in no time
It uses basic syntax (while and for loops).
We only have to import only two modules i.e. The 'sys' module in python, and the 'random' module of python (for generating random answers for the magic ball)

Below is a preview of the project:

It just produces random answers so don't take it seriously
